## Introduction

### (Unlabeled) PSI and Labeled PSI

Private Set Intersection (PSI) refers to a functionality where two parties, each holding a private set of *items*, can check which items they have in common without revealing anything else to each other.
Upper bounds on the sizes of the sets are assumed to be public information and are not protected.

The APSI (Asymmetric PSI) library provides a PSI functionality for asymmetric set sizes based on the protocol described in [eprint.iacr.org/2021/1116](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1116).
For example, in many cases one party may hold a large dataset of millions of records, and the other party wishes to find out whether a single particular record or a small number of records appear in the dataset.
We refer to this as APSI in *unlabeled* mode.

In many cases, however, the querier wishes to also retrieve some information per each record that matched.
This can be viewed as a key-value store with a privacy preserving batched query capability.
We use the terminology *item* and *label* to refer to the key and the value in such a key-value store, and call this APSI in  *labeled* mode.

**Note:** Unless labeled mode is actually needed, it will be much more efficient (in both communication and computation) to use the unlabeled mode.

### Sender and Receiver

We use the terminology *sender* and *receiver* to denote the two parties in the APSI protocol: a sender sends the result to the receiver.
For example, in a common use case where a server hosts a look-up table that multiple clients can query with encrypted records.
In this case the server acts as the sender, and the clients act as (independent) receivers.

## How APSI Works

### Homomorphic Encryption

APSI uses a relatively new encryption technology called homomorphic encryption that allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data.
Results of such computations remain encrypted and can be only decrypted by the owner of the secret key.
There are many homomorphic encryption schemes with different properties; APSI uses the BFV encryption scheme implemented in the [Microsoft SEAL](https://GitHub.com/Microsoft/SEAL) library.

#### Computation on Encrypted Data

Microsoft SEAL enables computation representable with arithmetic circuits (e.g., additions and multiplications modulo a prime number) with limited depths rather than arbitrary computation on encrypted data.
These computations can be done in a *batched* manner, where a single Microsoft SEAL ciphertext encrypts a large vector of values, and computations are done simultaneously and independently on every value in the vector; batching is crucial for APSI to achieve good performance.

#### Noise Budget

The capacity of computation that can be done on encrypted data is tracked by *noise budget* that each ciphertext carries.
A freshly encrypted ciphertext has a certain amount of noise budget which is then consumed by computations &ndash; particularly multiplications.
A ciphertext can no longer be decrypted correctly once its noise budget is fully consumed.
To support computations of larger multiplicative depths, it is necessary to start with a larger initial noise budget, which can be done through appropriate changes to the *encryption parameters*.

#### Encryption Parameters

Homomorphic encryption schemes, such as BFV, are difficult to configure for optimal performance.
APSI requires the user to explicitly provide the Microsoft SEAL encryption parameters.
So we need to describe them here briefly.
For much more details, we refer the reader to the [examples](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL/tree/main/native/examples) in the Microsoft SEAL repository.
We describe three important encryption parameters that the user should be familiar with.

`plain_modulus` is the easiest to understand.
It must be a prime number congruent to 1 modulo `2 * poly_modulus_degree` and defines the finite field datatype that the BFV scheme encrypts.
For example, if `plain_modulus` is 65537 &ndash; a 16-bit prime &ndash; then the scheme encrypts integers modulo 65537, and computations on encrypted data preserves integer arithmetic modulo 65537.
A larger `plain_modulus` leads to faster noise budget consumption.
It is recommended to design computation with as small a `plaint_modulus` as possible.

`poly_modulus_degree` is a positive power-of-two integer that determines how many integers modulo `plain_modulus` can be encoded into a single Microsoft SEAL plaintext; typical values are 2048, 4096, 8192, and 16384.
It is now easy for the reader to appreciate the value of batching: computation of thousands of values can be done at the cost of one computation on encrypted data.
`poly_modulus_degree` also affects the security level of the encryption scheme: if other parameters remain the same, a bigger `poly_modulus_degree` is more secure.

`coeff_modulus` is a set of prime numbers that determine the noise budget of a freshly encrypted ciphertext.
In Microsoft SEAL the `coeff_modulus` primes are rarely given explicitly by values but instead by bit counts &ndash; the library can create them.
In APSI it is necessary to specify at least two primes in `coeff_modulus`, but it is beneficial to have as few of them as possible; using 2 &ndash; 8 primes is probably reasonable.
The individual primes can be up to 60 bits.
The noise budget depends linearly on the total bit count of the primes.
`coeff_modulus` also affects the security level of the encryption scheme: if other parameters remain the same, a bigger total bit count is less secure.
Thus, to obtain more computing capability, i.e., more noise budget, one needs to increase the total bit count of the `coeff_modulus`, and consequently may have to increase `poly_modulus_degree` for security.
This will subsequently have an impact on the batching capability, so the computation itself may now change.

Fortunately, Microsoft SEAL prevents the user from accidentally setting insecure parameters.
It checks that, for the given `poly_modulus_degree`, the total `coeff_modulus` bit count does not exceed the following bounds:

| poly_modulus_degree | max coeff_modulus bit count |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1024                | 27                          |
| 2048                | 54                          |
| 4096                | 109                         |
| 8192                | 218                         |
| 16384               | 438                         |
| 32768               | 881                         |

In APSI, the user will need to explicitly provide the `coeff_modulus` prime bit counts, so the table above will be of great help in avoiding unnecessary exceptions being thrown by Microsoft SEAL.

### Theory

#### Naive Idea

The basic idea of APSI is as follows.
Suppose the sender holds a set `{Y_i}` of items &ndash; each an integer modulo `plain_modulus` &ndash; and the receiver holds a single item `X` &ndash; also an integer modulo `plain_modulus`.
The receiver can choose a secret key, encrypts `X` to obtain a ciphertext `Q = Enc(X)`, and sends it over to the sender.
The sender can now evaluate the *matching polynomial* `M(x) = (x - Y_0)(x - Y_1)...(x - Y_n)` at `x = Q`.
Here the values `Y_i` are unencrypted data held by the sender.
Due to the capabilities of homomorphic encryption, `M(Q)` will hold an encryption of `(X - Y_0)(X-Y_1)...(X-Y_n)` which is zero if `X` matches one of the sender's items and non-zero otherwise.
The sender who performs computation on `X` &ndash; encrypted data &ndash; will not be able to know this result due to the secret key being held only by the receiver.

One problem with the above is that the computation has an enormously high multiplicative depth.
It is not uncommon for the sender to have millions or even hundreds of millions of items.
This would require a very high initial noise budget and subsequently very large encryption parameters with an impossibly large computational overhead.

#### Lowering the Depth

The first step towards making this naive idea practical is to figure out ways of lowering the multiplicative depth of the computation.
First, notice that the sender can split up its set into `S` equally sized parts and evaluate the matching polynomial independently on each of the parts, producing `S` results `{M_i(Q)}`.
All of these results must be sent back to the receiver, so the sender-to-receiver communication has increased by a factor of `S`.
Nevertheless, this turns out to be a really valuable trick in helping reduce the size of the encryption parameters.

The second step is to use batching in Microsoft SEAL.
Per each of the `S` parts described above, the sender can further split its set into `poly_modulus_degree` many equally sized parts, and the receiver can batch-encrypt its item into a single batched query ciphertext `Q = Enc([ X, X, ..., X ])`.
Now, the sender can evaluate vectorized versions of the matching polynomials on `Q`, improving the computational complexity by a factor of `poly_modulus_degree` and significantly reducing the multiplicative depth.

The third step is to have the receiver compute higher powers of its query, encrypt those separately, and send them all to the sender.
Suppose the matching polynomials that the sender hopes to evaluate have degree `d`.
Then, the sender will need ciphertexts encrypting all powers of the receiver's query, up to power `d`.
Although the sender can always compute `Q^2`, ..., `Q^d` from a given `Q`, the computation can have high multiplicative depth even with the improvements described above.
Instead, suppose the receiver precomputes certain powers of its query, encrypts them, and sends them to the sender in addition to `Q`.
If the powers are chosen appropriately, the sender can compute all remaining necessary powers of `Q` with a much lower depth circuit.
The receiver-to-sender communication cost increases by a factor of how many powers were sent.
It is almost always beneficial to use this trick to reduce the multiplicative depth of the matching polynomials, and subsequently the size of the encryption parameters.

#### Cuckoo Hashing

The above techniques scale poorly when the receiver has more items.
Indeed, it would seem that the query needs to be repeated once per receiver's item, so if the receiver holds 10,000 items, the communicational and computational cost would massively increase.

There is a well-known technique for fixing this issue.
We use a hashing technique called cuckoo hashing, as implemented in the [Kuku](https://GitHub.com/Microsoft/Kuku) library.
Cuckoo hashing uses multiple hash functions (usually 2 &ndash; 4) to achieve very high packing rates for a hash table with a bin size of 1.
Instead of batch-encrypting its single item `X` into a query `Q` by repeating it into each batching slot, the receiver uses cuckoo hashing to insert multiple items `{X_i}` into a hash table of size `poly_modulus_degree` (the batch size) and bin size 1.
The cuckoo hash table is then encrypted to form a query `Q`, and is sent to the sender.

The sender uses all the different cuckoo hash functions to hash its items `{Y_i}` into a large hash table with arbitrarily sized bins; notably, it does not use cuckoo hashing.
In fact, it inserts each item multiple times &ndash; once per each cuckoo hash function.
This is necessary, because the sender cannot know which of the hash functions the receiver's cuckoo hashing process ended up using for each item.
If the number of cuckoo hash functions is `H`, then clearly this effectively increases the sender's set size by a factor of `H`.
After hashing its items the sender breaks down its hash table into parts as described above in [Lowering the Depth](#lowering-the-depth), and proceeds as before upon receiving `Q`.

The benefit is enormous.
Cuckoo hashing allows dense packing of the receiver's items into a single query `Q`.
For example, the receiver may be able to fit thousands of query items `{X_i}` into a single query `Q`, and the sender can perform the matching for all of these query items simultaneously, at the cost of increasing the sender's dataset size by a small factor `H`.

#### Large Items

Recall how each item had to be represented as an integer modulo `plain_modulus`.
Unfortunately, `plain_modulus` has usually 16 &ndash; 30 bits and always less than 60 bits in Microsoft SEAL.
Larger `plain_modulus` also causes larger noise budget consumption, lowering capability of computing on encrypted data.
On the other hand, we may need to support arbitrary length items.
For example, an item may be an entire document, an email address, a street address, or a driver's license number.
Two tricks make this possible.

The first trick is to apply a hash function to all items on both the sender's and receiver's side, so that they have a capped standard length.
We hash to 128 bits and truncate the hash to a shorter length (large enough to be collision-resistant) as necessary.
The shortest item length we support (after truncation) is 80 bits, which is still far above the practical sizes of `plain_modulus`.

The second trick is to break up each item into multiple parts and encode them separately into consecutive batching slots.
Namely, if `plain_modulus` is a `B`-bit prime, then we write only `B - 1` bits of an item into a batching slot and the next `B - 1` bits into the next slot.
One downside is that a batched plaintext/ciphertext now only holds a fraction of `poly_modulus_degree` items.
Typically we would use either 4 or 8 slots per item.
For example, if `plain_modulus` is a 20-bit prime, then 4 slots could encode an item of length 80, and the query ciphertext `Q` (and its powers) can encrypt up to `poly_modulus_degree / 4` of the receiver's items.
The receiver now queries substantially fewer items than before.
The solution is to decouple the cuckoo hash table size from the `poly_modulus_degree` and simply use two or more ciphertexts to encrypt `{X_i}` (and their powers).

#### OPRF

Unfortunately, the above approach reveals more than whether there is a match:
1. It allows the receiver to learn if parts of its query matched;
2. The result of the matching polynomial reveals information about the sender's data, even when there is no match.
These are significant issues and unacceptable.

The solution is to use an *Oblivious Pseudo-Random Function*, or *OPRF* for short.
An OPRF can be thought of as a keyed hash function `OPRF(s, -)` that only the sender knows; here `s` denotes the sender's key.
Further, the receiver can obtain `OPRF(s, X)` without learning the function `OPRF(s, -)` or the key `s`, and without the sender learning `X`.

The way to do this is simple.
The receiver hashes its item `X` to an elliptic curve point `A` in some cryptographically secure elliptic curve.
Next, the receiver chooses a secret number `r`, computes the point `B = rA`, and sends it to the sender.
The sender uses its secret `s` to compute `C = sB`, and sends it to back to the receiver.
Upon receiving `C`, the receiver computes the inverse `r^(-1)` modulo the order of the elliptic curve, and further computes `r^(-1) C = r^(-1) srA = sA`.
The receiver then extracts the OPRF hash value `OPRF(s, X)` from this point, for example by hashing its x-coordinate to an appropriate domain.

The sender knows `s`, so it can simply replace its items `{Y_i}` with `{OPRF(s, Y_i)}`.
The receiver needs to communicate with the sender to obtain `{OPRF(s, X_i)}`; once the receiver has received these values, the protocol can proceed as described above.
With OPRF, the problem of the receiver learning whether parts of its query matched goes away.
Since all the items are hashed with a hash function known only by the sender, the receiver will benefit nothing from learning parts of the sender's hashed items.
In fact, the sender's dataset is not private information and could in principle be sent in full to the receiver.
Homomorphic encryption only protects the receiver's data.

There is one further detail that must be mentioned here. We choose `OPRF(s, -)` to have a 256-bit output and denote its first 128 bits by `ItemHash(s, -)`.
Instead of `{OPRF(s, X_i)}` we use `{ItemHash(s, X_i)}` as the items; the reason will be given later in [Label Encryption](#label-encryption).

#### Paterson-Stockmeyer

In some cases it is beneficial for the sender to use the Paterson-Stockmeyer algorithm instead for evaluating the matching and label polynomials.
Consider a simple example where the matching polynomial happens to be
```
M(x) = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4 + 6x^5 + 7x^6 + 8x^7 + 9x^8 + 10x^9 + 11x^10 + 12x^11 + 13x^12 + 14x^13 + 15x^14.
```
To evaluate `M(Q)` for an encrypted query `Q=Enc(X)`, the sender must first compute all encrypted powers of `X` up to `X^14` from some number of source powers the receiver sends to the sender (see [Lowering the Depth](#lowering-the-depth)).
Next, the encrypted powers of `X` are multiplied with the encrypted coefficients of `M` and the results are added together.
It is important to note that the first step (computing all powers) involves a lot of ciphertext-ciphertext multiplications, while the second step (multiply with coefficients and adding) involves only ciphertext-plaintext multiplications, which are much faster than ciphertext-ciphertext multiplications.
If the sender splits it dataset into `S` equal parts (see [Lowering the Depth](#lowering-the-depth)), then the powers need to be computed only once and can be used repeatedly for each of the `S` parts.

Now consider the following approach, which is a special case of the Paterson-Stockmeyer algorithm.
The polynomial `M(x)` can be alternatively written as:
```
M(x) =     (1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3) +
        x^4(5 + 6x + 7x^2 + 8x^3) +
        x^8(9 + 10x + 11x^2 + 12x^3) +
       x^12(13 + 14x + 15x^2 + 0x^3).
```
To evaluate `M(Q)`, the sender needs to compute all encrypted powers of `X` up to `X^3`, and also `X^4`, `X^8`, and `X^12`: a total of 6 powers, as opposed to the 14 powers needed above.
Next the sender needs to evaluate the four degree-3 polynomials by computing ciphertext-plaintext multiplications with the appropriate powers and adding up the terms.
Then it needs to multiply the degree-3 polynomial results obtained above with appropriate powers of `X^4` (either `X^4`, `X^8`, or `X^12`) and add up the results.
One difference to the earlier approach is the number of ciphertext-ciphertext multiplications: in the first approach the number is 14 minus the number of precomputed powers the receiver sent; in the second approach it is 6 minor the number of precomputed powers the receiver sent.
Another key difference is that the number of costly ciphertext-ciphertext multiplications is now proportional to `S`.

We decided to group the terms above into degree-3 polynomials, but we could have chosen to use either lower or higher degree polynomials instead.
Different choices result in different communication-computation trade-offs.
We refer to the degree of these inner polynomials as the *(Paterson-Stockmeyer) low-degree*.
As is obvious from above, the sender must also compute powers of `low-degree + 1` of the query; we call `low-degree + 1` the *(Paterson-Stockmeyer) high-degree*.

The user may want to ensure that the multiplicative depth of computing the inner polynomials &ndash; taking into account an *additional level* from multiplying by the plaintext coefficients &ndash; matches the multiplicative depth of computing the powers of `high-degree`.
This way the last multiplication will be depth-optimal.

### Practice

We now begin to illustrate how the [Theory](#theory) is implemented in APSI.
Our discussion only considers the unlabeled mode; the labeled mode is not very different, and we will discuss it later.
For simplicity, we assume that the [OPRF](#oprf) step has already been performed, and consider the simplified case where the receiver needs only a single ciphertext (and its powers) to encrypt the query.
This could happen, for example, if `poly_modulus_degree` is 16, each item uses 2 batching slots, and the cuckoo hash table size is 8; these numbers are too small to work in reality, but are helpful to illustrate the concepts.
Suppose the receiver wants to perform a query for a vector of items as follows.
```
Receiver's query vector

[ item92  ]
[ item14  |
[ item79  ]
[ item3   ]
[ item401 ]
```
After cuckoo hashing, the receiver's view is as follows.
The entire vector of size 16 becomes a single Microsoft SEAL ciphertext.

```
Receiver's cuckoo hash table

[ item79-part1  ]
[ item79-part2  ]
[ empty         ]
[ empty         ]
[ item14-part1  ]
[ item14-part2  ]
[ item92-part1  ]
[ item92-part2  ]  ==>  query-ctxt
[ item401-part1 ]
[ item401-part2 ]
[ empty         ]
[ empty         ]
[ empty         ]
[ empty         ]
[ item3-part1   ]
[ item3-part2   ]
```

The sender creates one big hash table and then breaks it into several independent *bin bundles*.
The matching polynomials for each bin bundle are evaluated independently on `query-ctxt`; this is the first idea presented in [Lowering the Depth](#lowering-the-depth).
For simplicity, we ignore the fact that the sender must use all of the cuckoo hash functions to insert each item.
```
Sender's big hash table

[ item416-part1 | item12-part1  ][ item71-part1  | item611-part1 ]
[ item416-part2 | item12-part2  ][ item71-part2  | item611-part2 ]
[ item125-part1 | item9-part1   ][ item512-part1 | empty         ]
[ item125-part2 | item9-part2   ][ item512-part2 | empty         ]
[ item500-part1 | item277-part1 ][ item14-part1  | item320-part1 ]
[ item500-part2 | item277-part2 ][ item14-part2  | item320-part2 ]
[ item92-part1  | empty         ][ empty         | empty         ]
[ item92-part2  | empty         ][ empty         | empty         ]
[ item498-part1 | item403-part1 ][ item88-part1  | item5-part1   ]
[ item498-part2 | item403-part2 ][ item88-part2  | item5-part2   ]
[ item216-part1 | empty         ][ empty         | empty         ]
[ item216-part2 | empty         ][ empty         | empty         ]
[ item315-part1 | item491-part1 ][ item262-part1 | empty         ]
[ item315-part2 | item491-part2 ][ item262-part1 | empty         ]
[ item100-part1 | item37-part1  ][ item90-part1  | item3-part1   ]
[ item100-part2 | item37-part2  ][ item90-part2  | item3-part2   ]

\-------------------------------/\-------------------------------/
           Bin bundle 1                     Bin bundle 2
```
The sender's table is created by first starting with a single bin bundle.
Imagine first `item416` is inserted and it happens to land in the very first bin of the hash table.
Next suppose we add `item500`, `item125`, `item12`, `item9`, and finally `item512` into the bins as shown in the diagram.

APSI allows to specify how many items the sender can fit (horizontally) into each bin bundle.
For the sake of this example, we shall assume that this value is 2, but in reality it would be larger.

Once more room is needed, a new bin bundle is created.
The sender started with only *Bin bundle 1*, but `item512` would land in the same bin as `item125` and `item9`, which is already full according to our bound of 2.
Hence, APSI creates *Bin bundle 2* and inserts `item512` into it.
Next, `item277` is inserted into *Bin bundle 1* since there is still room for it.
In the end, we may end up with dozens or hundreds of bin bundles, and some of the last bin bundles to be added may be left with many empty locations.

For the matching, the encrypted query `query-ctxt` is matched &ndash; in encrypted form &ndash; against both *Bin bundle 1* and *Bin bundle 2*, producing results `result-ctxt-1` and `result-ctxt-2` which are sent back to the receiver.
The receiver decrypts the results and finds a result as follows.
```
Receiver decrypting the result

                    [ item79-no-match  ]                            [ item79-no-match  ]
                    [ empty            ]                            [ empty            ]
                    [ item14-no-match  ]                            [ item14-match     ]
result-ctxt-1  ==>  [ item92-match     ]        result-ctxt-2  ==>  [ item92-no-match  ]
                    [ item401-no-match ]                            [ item401-no-match ]
                    [ empty            ]                            [ empty            ]
                    [ empty            ]                            [ empty            ]
                    [ item3-no-match   ]                            [ item3-match      ]
```
APSI computes the logical OR of the match values for each result ciphertext and orders the results according to the order of the items appearing in the original query producing, for example, a result vector as follows.
The order of the items in the query is arbitrary and irrelevant.
```
Receiver's query vector      Receiver's result vector

[ item92  ]                  [ match    ]
[ item14  ]                  [ match    ]
[ item79  ]                  [ no-match ]
[ item3   ]                  [ match    ]
[ item401 ]                  [ no-match ]
```
The receiver, in this case, concludes that `item92`, `item14`, and `item3` are all present in the sender's database, whereas the other items are not.

A few important details are omitted from the description above.
First, the original items on either side are never inserted directly into the APSI protocol, but instead their OPRF hashes are used.

Second, the sender needs to insert each item multiple times, once using each of the cuckoo hash functions.
For example, if three cuckoo hash functions are used, the sender would insert, e.g., `Hash1(item92)`, `Hash2(item92)`, and `Hash3(item92)`.
The receiver, on the other hand, has inserted only `Hash?(item92)`, where `Hash?` is one of the three hash functions; in any case, the match will be discovered.
Thus, our diagram above is misleading: we should have used names like `item92-hash1-part1`.

Third, as explained in [Large Items](#large-items), in many cases the receiver's query consists of multiple ciphertexts &ndash; not just one like above.
For example, suppose we use a cuckoo hash table of size 32, instead of size 8.
Now a single plaintext cannot encode the receiver's query anymore.
Instead, the query is broken into 4 ciphertexts, each encoding a contiguous chunck of the bigger cuckoo hash table.

```
A similar breakdown takes place on the sender's side, creating a jagged array of bin bundles.
Here is an example of what the sender's view could be.
```
                +------------++------------++------------+
                |            ||            ||            |
Bundle index 0  | Bin bundle || Bin bundle || Bin bundle |
                |            ||            ||            |
                +------------++------------++------------+
                +------------++------------+
                |            ||            |
Bundle index 1  | Bin bundle || Bin bundle |
                |            ||            |
                +------------++------------+
                +------------++------------++------------++------------+
                |            ||            ||            ||            |
Bundle index 2  | Bin bundle || Bin bundle || Bin bundle || Bin bundle |
                |            ||            ||            ||            |
                +------------++------------++------------++------------+
                +------------++------------++------------+
                |            ||            ||            |
Bundle index 3  | Bin bundle || Bin bundle || Bin bundle |
                |            ||            ||            |
                +------------++------------++------------+
```
When the sender receives `query-ctxt0`, it must compute the matching for each bin bundle at bundle index 0.
Similarly, `query-ctxt1` must be matched against each bin bundle at bundle index 1, and so on.
The number of result ciphertexts obtained by the receiver will be equal to the total number of bin bundles held by the sender; the client cannot know this number in advance.

### Labeled Mode

#### Basic Idea

The labeled mode is not too different but requires some extra explanation.
The receiver, in addition to learning whether its query items are in the sender's set, will learn data the sender has associated to these items.
One can think of this as a key-value store with privacy-preserving querying.

To understand how the labeled mode works, recall from [Basic Idea](#basic-idea) how the matching polynomial `M(x)` outputs either an encryption of zero or an encryption of a non-zero value when being evaluated at the receiver's encrypted item `Q`.
In the labeled mode, the sender creates another polynomial `L(x)`, the *label interpolation polynomial*, that has the following property: if `{(Y_i, V_i)}` denotes the sender's set of item-label pairs, then `L(Y_i) = V_i`.
Upon receiving `Q`, the sender computes the ciphertext pair `(M(Q), L(Q))` and returns them to the receiver.
The receiver decrypts the pair and checks whether the first value decrypts to zero.
If it does, the second value decrypts to the corresponding label.

#### Large Labels

One immediate issue is that all encrypted computations happen modulo the `plain_modulus`, but the sender's labels might be much longer than that.
This was a problem for the items, and was resolved in [Large Items](#large-items) by hashing the items first to a bounded size (80 &ndash; 128 bits) and then using a sequence of batching slots to encode the items.
This solution works to some extent for labels as well.
Namely, the labels can be broken into parts similarly to how the items are, and for each part we can form a label interpolation polynomial that outputs that part of the label when evaluated at the corresponding part of the item.

This is not yet a fulfilling solution, because our items do not have a fixed size and are fairly short anyway (up to 128 bits).
Labels that are longer than the items can be broken into multiple parts each of the length of the item.
For each part we can construct a separate label interpolation polynomial, evaluate them all at the encrypted query, and return each encrypted result to the receiver.
The receiver decrypts the results and concatenates them to recover the label for those items that were matched.

#### Label Encryption

There is a serious issue with the above approach that must be resolved.
Recall how we used [OPRF](#oprf) to prevent partial (or full) leakage of the sender's items to the receiver: given an item `Y`, the matching polynomial is not actually computed for `Y` itself, but rather for `ItemHash(s, Y)`, which denoted the first 128 bits of the item's OPRF value `OPRF(s, Y)`.
This means that the label interpolation polynomial `L` should actually have the property that `L(ItemHash(s, Y_i)) = V_i` for each of the sender's items `Y_i`.
However, if the receiver can guess a part of some `ItemHash(s, Y_i)` it can use it to query for the corresponding part of the label for that item, which is unacceptable since the receiver does not actually know the item `Y_i`.

To solve this issue, the sender uses a symmetric encryption function `Enc(<input>, <key>, <nonce>)` to encrypt the labels `V_i` using keys derived from `OPRF(s, Y_i)`.
Specifically, as the encryption key `LabelKey(s, Y_i)` for the label `V_i` corresponding to an item `Y_i` we use the remaining 128 bits of the 256-bit output of `OPRF(s, Y_i)`, so the label we must communicate to the receiver becomes `Enc(V_i, LabelKey(s, Y_i), nonce)`.

There is still a bit of a problem, because the receiver must somehow know the nonce as well.
One option is to use a constant or empty nonce.
In this case extreme care must be taken, because if an adversary can learn encryptions of two different labels for the same item with the same OPRF key `s`, then they may be able to learn information about the labels.
This can happen, because APSI supports updating labels for items.
Another option is to use a long randomly generated nonce &ndash; different for each encryption &ndash; which the receiver must somehow learn.
APSI achieves this by randomly sampling a nonce, concatenating it with the encryption of `V_i`, and using the concatenation for the interpolation polynomial `L`.
In other words, the sender samples a random nonce for each item `Y_i` and computes the label interpolation polynomial `L` such that `L(ItemHash(s, Y_i)) = nonce | Enc(V_i, LabelKey(s, Y_i), nonce)`.

The receiver benefits nothing from learning parts (or all) of the encrypted label unless it also knows the original item.
Furthermore, even if the receiver manages to obtain `nonce | Enc(V_i, LabelKey(s, Y_i), nonce)` by guessing `ItemHash(s, Y_i)`, and in an offline attack enumerates all possible items `Y_i` (or later learns `Y_i` through other means), it still cannot obtain the label because `LabelKey(s, Y_i)` is derived from `OPRF(s, Y_i)` &ndash; not just from `Y_i`.
Of course at this later point the sender may decide to serve a normal query to the receiver for `Y_i`, in which case the receiver will learn `V_i`, as it is supposed to.

APSI allows the sender can specify the nonce size in bytes.
The default nonce size is set to 16 bytes, but expert users who fully understand the issue may want to use smaller values to achieve improved performance.

#### Partial Item Collisions

There is one last subtle issue that must be addressed.
Recall from [Practice](#practice) how the sender constructs a large hash table and breaks it into a jagged array of bin bundles.
In the labeled mode each bin bundle holds not only the item parts in it, but also the corresponding label parts, and the label interpolation polynomials, as described above.
The interpolation polynomials are not created for the entire label at a time, but for each part separately, although the encryption is applied to the full item before decomposing it into parts.

Now consider what happens when &ndash; by change &ndash; `item416-part1` and `item12-part1` (as in [Practice](#practice)) are the same.
If the corresponding label parts `label416-part1` and `label12-part1` are different, it will be impossible to create a label interpolation polynomial `L`, as it cannot output both `label416-part1` and `label12-part1` on the corresponding item part.

This issue is resolved by checking that label parts do not already appear in the same locations before inserting an item into a bin bundle.
If any of them does, the item simply cannot be inserted into that bin bundle, and a new bin bundle for the same bundle index must be created.
Note that the problem exists only in the labeled mode and can lead to worse *packing rate* (`items_inserted / theoretical_max`) than in unlabeled mode, where no such limitation exists.

## Using APSI

### Receiver

The `apsi::receiver::Receiver` class implements all necessary functions to create and send parameter, OPRF, and PSI or labeled PSI queries (depending on the sender), and process any responses received.
Most of the member functions are static, but a few (related to creating and processing the query itself) require an instance of the class to be created.
All functions and types are in the `apsi` namespace, so we omit `apsi::` from all names below.
For simplicity, we also use `Receiver` to denote `apsi::receiver::Receiver`.

This same text appears in the [receiver.h](receiver/apsi/receiver.h) header file.

`Receiver` includes functionality to request protocol parameters (`PSIParams` object) from a sender.
This is needed when the receiver does not know what parameters it is supposed to use with a specific sender.
In other cases the receiver would know the parameters ahead of time, and can skip this step.
In any case, once the receiver has an appropriate `PSIParams` object, an `Receiver` can be instantiated.
The `Receiver` constructor automatically creates Microsoft SEAL public and private keys.
The public keys are sent to the sender along with every query request, and the private keys are held internally by the Receiver object for decrypting query responses.
New keys can be generated by calling the member function `Receiver::reset_keys`, and we recommend doing this after every query has been completed to
protect against leaked keys.

The class includes two versions of an API to performs the necessary operations.
The "simple" API consists of three functions: `Receiver::RequestParams`, `Receiver::RequestOPRF`, and `Receiver::request_query`.
However, these functions only support `network::NetworkChannel`, such as `network::ZMQReceiverChannel`, for the communication.
Other channels, such as `network::StreamChannel`, are only supported by the "advanced" API.

The advanced API requires many more steps.
The full process is as follows:

0. (optional) `Receiver::CreateParamsRequest` must be used to create a parameter request.
The request must be sent to the sender on a channel with `network::Channel::send`.
The sender must respond to the request and the response must be received on the channel with `network::Channel::receive_response`.
The received `Response` object must be converted to the right type (`ParamsResponse`) with the `to_params_response` function.
This function will return `nullptr` if the received response was not of the right type.
A `PSIParams` object can be extracted from the response.

1. A `Receiver` object must be created from a `PSIParams` object. The `PSIParams` must match what the sender uses.

1. `Receiver::CreateOPRFReceiver` must be used to process the input vector of items and return an associated `oprf::OPRFReceiver` object.
Next, `Receiver::CreateOPRFRequest` must be used to create an OPRF request from the `oprf::OPRFReceiver`, which can subsequently be sent to the sender with `network::Channel::send`.
The sender must respond to the request and the response must be received on the channel with `network::Channel::receive_response`.
The received `Response` object must be converted to the right type (`OPRFResponse`) with the `to_oprf_response` function. This function will return `nullptr` if the received response was not of the right type.
Finally, `Receiver::ExtractHashes` must be called with the `OPRFResponse` and the `oprf::OPRFReceiver` object.
This function returns `std::pair<std::vector<HashedItem>, std::vector<LabelKey>>`, containing the OPRF hashed items and the label encryption keys.
Both vectors in this pair must be kept for the next steps.

1. `Receiver::create_query` (non-static member function) must then be used to create the query itself.
The function returns `std::pair<Request, IndexTranslationTable>`, where the `Request` object contains the query itself to be send to the sender, and the `IndexTranslationTable` is an object associated to this query describing how the internal data structures of the query maps to the vector of OPRF hashed items given to `Receiver::create_query`.
The `IndexTranslationTable` is needed later to process the responses from the sender.
The `Request` object must be sent to the sender with `network::Channel::send`.
The received `Response` object must be converted to the right type (`QueryResponse`) with the `to_query_response` function.
This function will return `nullptr` if the received response was not of the right type.
The `QueryResponse` contains only one important piece of data: the number of `ResultPart` objects the receiver should expect to receive from the sender in the next step.

1. `network::Channel::receive_result` must be called repeatedly to receive all `ResultParts`.
For each received `ResultPart`, `Receiver::process_result_part` must be called to find a `std::vector<MatchRecord>` representing the match data associated to that `ResultPart`.
Alternatively, one can first retrieve all `ResultParts`, collect them into a `std::vector<ResultPart>`, and use `Receiver::process_result` to find the complete result &ndash; just like what the simple API returns.
Both `Receiver::process_result_part` and `Receiver::process_result` require the `IndexTranslationTable` and the `std::vector<LabelKey>` objects created in the previous steps.

### Request, Response, and ResultPart

The `Request` type is defined in [requests.h](common/apsi/requests.h) as an alias for `std::unique_ptr<network::SenderOperation>`, where `network::SenderOperation` is a purely virtual class representing either a parameter request (`network::SenderOperationParms`), an OPRF request (`network::SenderOperationOPRF`), or a PSI or labeled PSI query request (`network::SenderOperationQuery`).
The types `ParamsRequest`, `OPRFRequest`, and `QueryRequest` are similar aliases to unique pointers of these derived types.
The functions `to_params_request`, `to_oprf_request`, and `to_query_request` convert a `Request` into the specific kind of request, returning `nullptr` if the `Request` was not of the right type.
Conversely, the `to_request` function converts a `ParamsRequest`, `OPRFRequest`, or `QueryRequest` into a `Request` object.

Similarly, the `Response` type is defined in [responses.h](common/apsi/responses.h) as an alias for `std::unique_ptr<network::SenderOperationResponse>`, along with related type aliases `ParamsResponse`, `OPRFResponse`, and `QueryResponse`, and corresponding conversion functions `to_params_response`, `to_oprf_responset`, `to_query_response`, and `to_response`.

Finally, the `ResultPart` type is defined in [responses.h](common/apsi/responses.h) as an alias for `std::unique_ptr<network::ResultPackage>`, where `network::ResultPackage` contains an encrypted result to a query request.
Since the query is evaluated independently per each bin bundle (recall [Practice](#practice)), the results for each bin bundle are sent back to the receiver as separate `ResultPart` objects.
The receiver must collect all these together to find the final result, as was described above in [Receiver](#receiver).

The important thing about `Request`, `Response`, and `ResultPart` is that these are the object handled by the `network::Channel` class member functions `send`, `receive_operation`, `receive_response`, and `receive_result` (see [channel.h](common/apsi/network/channel.h)).

### Sender

The `Sender` class implements all necessary functions to process and respond to parameter, OPRF, and PSI or labeled PSI queries (depending on the sender).
Unlike the `Receiver` class, `Sender` also takes care of actually sending data back to the receiver.
Sender is a static class and cannot be instantiated.

All functions and types are in the `apsi` namespace, so we omit `apsi::` from all names below.
For simplicity, we also use `Sender` to denote `apsi::sender::Sender`, and `SenderDB` to denote `apsi::sender::SenderDB`.

This same text appears in the [sender.h](sender/apsi/sender.h) header file.

Just like `Receiver`, there are two ways of using `Sender`. The "simple" approach supports `network::ZMQSenderChannel` and is implemented in the `ZMQSenderDispatcher` class in [zmq/sender_dispatcher.h](sender/apsi/zmq/sender_dispatcher.h).
The `ZMQSenderDispatcher` provides a very fast way of deploying an APSI `Sender`: it automatically binds to a ZeroMQ socket, starts listening to requests, and acts on them as appropriate.

The advanced `Sender` API consisting of three functions: `RunParams`, `RunOPRF`, and `RunQuery`.
Of these, `RunParams` and `RunOPRF` take the request object (`ParamsRequest` or `OPRFRequest`) as input.
`RunQuery` requires the `QueryRequest` to be "unpacked" into a `Query` object first.

The full process for the sender is as follows:

1. Create an `oprf::OPRFKey` object and use `oprf::OPRFSender::ComputeHashes` with the `oprf::OPRFKey` to process the sender's items (or item-label pairs) and convert them into hashed items (or hashed-item-label pairs).

1. Create a `PSIParams` object and a `SenderDB` object. The `SenderDB` must be created with the `PSIParams` and the hashed items (or hashed item-label pairs) must be loaded into it with `SenderDB::set_data`.
The `SenderDB` can be used repeatedly and can be updated efficiently.

1. (optional) Receive a parameter request with `network::Channel::receive_operation`.
The received `Request` object must be converted to the right type (`ParamsRequest`) with the `to_params_request` function.
This function will return `nullptr` if the received request was not of the right type.
Once the request has been obtained, the `RunParams` function can be called with the `ParamsRequest`, the `SenderDB`, the `network::Channel`, and optionally a lambda function that implements custom logic for sending the `ParamsResponse` object on the channel.

1. Receive an OPRF request with `network::Channel::receive_operation`.
The received `Request` object must be converted to the right type (`OPRFRequest`) with the `to_oprf_request` function.
This function will return `nullptr` if the received request was not of the right type.
Once the request has been obtained, the `RunOPRF` function can be called with the `OPRFRequest`, the `oprf::OPRFKey`, the `network::Channel`, and optionally a lambda function that implements custom logic for sending the `OPRFResponse` object on the channel.

1. Receive a query request with `network::Channel::receive_operation`. The received `Request` object must be converted to the right type (`QueryRequest`) with the `to_query_request` function.
This function will return `nullptr` if the received request was not of the right type.
Once the request has been obtained, a `Query` object must be created from it.
The constructor of the `Query` class verifies that the `QueryRequest` is valid for the given `SenderDB`, and if it is not the constructor still returns successfully but the `Query` is marked as invalid (`Query::is_valid()` returns `false`) and cannot be used in the next step.
Once a valid `Query` object is created, the `RunQuery` function can be used to perform the query and respond on the given channel.
Optionally, two lambda functions can be given to `RunQuery` to provide custom logic for sending the `QueryResponse` and the `ResultPart` objects on the channel.

### SenderDB

For simplicity, we use `SenderDB` to denote `apsi::sender::SenderDB`.

This same text appears in the [sender_db.h](sender/apsi/sender_db.h) header file.

A `SenderDB` maintains an in-memory representation of the sender's set of items and labels (in labeled mode).
These items are not simply copied into the `SenderDB` data structures, but also preprocessed heavily to allow for faster online computation time.
Since inserting a large number of new items into a `SenderDB` can take time, it is not recommended to recreate the `SenderDB` when the database changes a little bit.
Instead, the class supports fast update and deletion operations that should be preferred: `SenderDB::insert_or_assign` and `SenderDB::remove`.

The `SenderDB` constructor allows the label byte count to be specified; unlabeled mode is activated by setting the label byte count to zero.
It is possible to optionally specify the size of the nonce used in encrypting the labels, but this is best left to its default value unless the user is absolutely sure of what they are doing.

The `SenderDB` requires substantially more memory than the raw data would.
Part of that memory can automatically be compressed when it is not in use; this feature is enabled by default, and can be disabled when constructing the `SenderDB`.
The downside of in-memory compression is a performance reduction from decompressing parts of the data when they are used, and recompressing them if they are updated.

In many cases the `SenderDB` does not need to be modified after having been constructed, or loaded from disk.
The function `SenderDB::strip` can be called to remove all data that is not strictly needed to serve query requests.
A `SenderDB` that has been stripped cannot be modified, cannot be checked for the presence of specific items, and labels cannot be retrieved from it.
A stripped `SenderDB` can be serialized and deserialized.

### PSIParams

The `apsi::PSIParams` class encapsulates parameters for the PSI or labeled PSI protocol.
These parameters are important to set correctly to ensure correct behavior and good performance.
All of the concepts behind these parameters have come up in [How APSI Works](#how-apsi-works), which we urge the reader to review unless it is absolutely clear to them.

If a parameter set works for specific sender and receiver sets, then it will always work for a smaller or larger sender's set as well (with asymptotic linear scaling in communication and computation complexity), both in the unlabeled and labeled mode with arbitrary length labels.
However, it does not necessarily work for a larger receiver's set.

For simplicity, we use `PSIParams` to denote `apsi::PSIParams`.

A `PSIParams` object contains four kinds of parameters, encapsulated in sub-structs: `PSIParams::SEALParams`, `PSIParams::ItemParams`, `PSIParams::TableParams`, and `PSIParams::QueryParams`.
We shall discuss each separately.

#### SEALParams

The `PSIParams::SEALParams` simply wraps an instance of Microsoft SEAL `seal::EncryptionParameters` object with the encryption scheme always set to `seal::scheme_type::bfv`.
Unfortunately these parameters are not entirely easy to comprehend, and while some explanation was given above in [Encryption Parameters](#encryption-parameters), we highly recommend the reader study the extensive comments in the Microsoft SEAL [examples](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL/tree/main/native/examples) to have a better grasp of how the parameters should be set, and what their impact on performance is.

#### ItemParams

The `PSIParams::ItemParams` struct contains only one member variable: a 32-bit integer `felts_per_item`.
This number was described in [Large Items](#large-items); it specifies how many Microsoft SEAL [batching slots](#encryption-parameters) should represent each item, and hence influences the item length.

The item length (in bits) is a product of `felts_per_item` and `floor(log_2(plain_modulus))`, where `plain_modulus` refers to the Microsoft SEAL [plain_modulus](#encryption-parameters) parameter set in the `PSIParams::SEALParams`.
The `PSIParams` constructor will verify that the item length is bounded between 80 and 128 bits, and will throw an exception otherwise.

`felts_per_item` must be one of 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32.

#### TableParams

The `PSIParams::TableParams` struct contains parameters describing the receiver's [cuckoo hash table](#cuckoo-hashing) and the [sender's data structure](#practice).
It holds three member variables:
- `table_size` denotes the size of the receiver's cuckoo hash table.
It must be such that its size is a positive multiple of (possibly equal to) the number of batching slots in a Microsoft SEAL plaintext, i.e., it must be a multiple of the [poly_modulus_degree](#encryption-parameters) parameter set in the `PSIParams::SEALParams`.
- `max_items_per_bin` denotes how many items fit into each row of the sender's bin bundles.
It cannot be zero.
- `hash_func_count` denotes the number of hash functions used for cuckoo hashing.
It must be at least 1 and at most 8.
While setting `hash_func_count` to 1 means essentially disabling cuckoo hashing, it can improve performance in cases where the receiver is known to have only a single item (set membership).

#### QueryParams

The `PSIParams::QueryParams` struct contains two parameters: a `std::uint32_t` called `ps_low_degree`, and a `std::set<std::uint32_t>` called `query_powers`.
`ps_low_degree` determined the Paterson-Stockmeyer low-degree, as was discused in [Paterson-Stockmeyer](#paterson-stockmeyer).
If set to zero, the Paterson-Stockmeyer algorithm is not used.
`query_powers` defines which encrypted powers of the query the receiver sends to the sender, as was discussed in [Lowering the Depth](#lowering-the-depth).
This is one of the most complex parameters to set, which is why we have dedicated an [entire subsection below](#query-powers) for describing how to choose it.

`ps_low_degree` can be any number between 0 and `max_items_per_bin`, although values 1 and `max_items_per_bin` are meaningless to use.
`query_powers` must contain 1, cannot contain 0, and cannot contain values larger than `max_items_per_bin`.
Any value in `query_powers` larger than `ps_low_degree` must be a multiple of `ps_low_degree + 1`.

#### PSIParams Constructor

To construct a `PSIParams` object, one needs to provide the constructor with a valid `PSIParams::SEALParams`, `PSIParams::ItemParams`, `PSIParams::TableParams`, and `PSIParams::QueryParams`. The constructor will perform the following validations on the parameters, in order, and will throw an exception (with a descriptive message) if any of them fails:

1. `PSIParams::TableParams::table_size` is verified to be non-zero.
1. `PSIParams::TableParams::max_items_per_bin` is verified to be non-zero.
1. `PSIParams::TableParams::hash_func_count` is verified to be at least 1 and at most 8.
1. `PSIParams::ItemParams::felts_per_item` is verified to be 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32.
1. `PSIParams::QueryParams::ps_low_degree` is verified to not exceed `max_items_per_bin`.
1. `PSIParams::QueryParams::query_powers` is verified to not contain 0, to contain 1, and to not contain values larger than `max_items_per_bin`.
Any value larger than `ps_low_degree` is verified to be divisible by `ps_low_degree + 1`.
1. `PSIParams::SEALParams` are verified to be valid and to support Microsoft SEAL batching.
Specificially, the parameters must have a `plain_modulus` that is prime and congruent to 1 modulo `2 * poly_modulus_degree`.
Microsoft SEAL contains functions in `seal::CoeffModulus` and `seal::PlainModulus` classes (see [modulus.h](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL/blob/main/native/src/seal/modulus.h)) to choose appropriate `coeff_modulus` and `plain_modulus` primes.
1. The item bit count is computed as the product of `felts_per_item` and `floor(log_2(plain_modulus))`, and is verified to be at least 80 and at most 128.
1. The number of item fitting vertically in a bin bundle is computed as `poly_modulus_degree / felts_per_item`.
This number is verified to be non-zero.
1. `table_size` is verified to be a multiple of `poly_modulus_degree / felts_per_item`.

If all of these checks pass, the `PSIParams` object is successfully created and is valid for use in APSI.

#### Loading from JSON

A `PSIParams` object can be most conveniently created from a JSON string with the `PSIParams::Load` method.
The format of the JSON string is as in the following example:
```
{
    "table_params": {
        "hash_func_count": 3,
        "table_size": 512,
        "max_items_per_bin": 92
    },
    "item_params": {
        "felts_per_item": 8
    },
    "query_params": {
        "ps_low_degree": 0,
        "query_powers": [ 3, 4, 5, 8, 14, 20, 26, 32, 38, 41, 42, 43, 45, 46 ]
    },
    "seal_params": {
        "plain_modulus": 40961,
        "poly_modulus_degree": 4096,
        "coeff_modulus_bits": [ 49, 40, 20 ]
    }
}
```
The Microsoft SEAL `plain_modulus` parameter can be set to a specific prime, like in the example above in the `seal_params` section, or can be expressed as a desired number of bits for the prime, in which case the library will sample a prime of appropriate form. In such a case, the `seal_params` section would appear as follows:
```
    ...
    "seal_params": {
        "plain_modulus_bits": 24,
        "poly_modulus_degree": 4096,
        "coeff_modulus_bits": [ 49, 40, 20 ]
    }
    ...

```

We provide multiple example parameter sets in the [parameters/](parameters/) subdirectory.
The files are named with triples of numbers, where the first two indicate recommended upper bounds for the sender's and receiver's set sizes, respectively, and the third (optional) number indicates that the parameters are meant for use in labeled mode and denote the label byte size.
The file names end with an optional specifier `-com` or `-cmp`, indicating whether the parameters are optimized to minimize communication or computation cost.

### Query Powers

It is unfortunately difficult to find good choices for the `query_powers` parameter in `PSIParams`.
This is related to the so-called *global postage-stamp problem* in combinatorial number theory (see [Challis and Robinson (2010)](http://emis.impa.br/EMIS/journals/JIS/VOL13/Challis/challis6.pdf)).
In short, the global postage-stamp problem can be stated as follows:

For given positive integers `h` and `k`, determine a set of k integers `{ a_i | 1 = a_0 < a_1 < ... < a_k }`, such that
- any positive integer up to n can be realized as a sum of at most `h` of the `a_i` (possibly with repetition), and
- `n` is as large as possible.

For example, if `h = 2` and `k = 3`, then `{ 1, 3, 4 }` provides a solution for `n = 8`.
This is easy to verify:

| Value | First summand | Second summand |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| 1     | 1             | N/A            |
| 2     | 1             | 1              |
| 3     | 3             | N/A            |
| 4     | 4             | N/A            |
| 5     | 1             | 4              |
| 6     | 3             | 3              |
| 7     | 3             | 4              |
| 8     | 4             | 4              |

For a larger example, if `h = 3` and `k = 3`, then `{ 1, 4, 5 }` provides a solution for `n = 15`.
Simply start from 1 and write each number, in order, a sum of two of the previous numbers, in a way that minimizes the total number of summands:

| Value | First summand | Second summand | Total # of summands |
|-------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 1     | 1             | N/A            | 1                   |
| 2     | 1             | 1              | 2                   |
| 3     | 1             | 2              | 3                   |
| 4     | 4             | N/A            | 1                   |
| 5     | 5             | N/A            | 1                   |
| 6     | 1             | 5              | 2                   |
| 7     | 2             | 5              | 3                   |
| 8     | 4             | 4              | 2                   |
| 9     | 4             | 5              | 2                   |
| 10    | 5             | 5              | 2                   |
| 11    | 5             | 6              | 3                   |
| 12    | 4             | 8              | 3                   |
| 13    | 5             | 8              | 3                   |
| 14    | 4             | 10             | 3                   |
| 15    | 5             | 10             | 3                   |

The choice of `{ 1, 4, 5 }` is optimal in the sense that there is no set `{a_i}` of size 3 (`k = 3`) that allows for `n >= 16` without at least 4 total summands (`h = 4`).

The above table can now immediately be represented as a directed graph with each value (integers 1 through 15) labeling the nodes and the *is-a-summand-of* relationship represented by directed edges.
In this case `{ 1, 4, 5 }` will appear as sink nodes.

Now, recall from [Practice](#practice) how bin bundle rows can hold only a predetermined number of items.
For this example, suppose that number was 15.
Then, once the sender receives a query ciphertext from the receiver, it must compute &ndash; in encrypted form &ndash; all powers of the query up to 15.
Computing these powers will require a circuit of multiplicative depth 4.
Evaluating the matching polynomials will further require an additional multiplication (by the coefficients), so in the end the encrypted computation will have multiplicative depth 5: this requires large encryption parameters.
Instead, the receiver can precompute the 4th and the 5th powers of the query, encrypt them, and send them to the sender in addition to the query itself (1st power).
Now the sender can use the graph to compute all powers of the query in an efficient manner with only a depth 2 circuit.
The coefficient multiplications will increase the depth of the full computation to 3, but this is considerably better than 5, and will allow for much smaller encryption parameters to be used.
The downside is, of course, that the communication from the receiver to the sender is now three times larger than if only the query itself was sent.
Still, the reduction in the size of the parameters is typically immensely beneficial, and using appropriate source powers will be the key to good performance.

We recommend using the tables in [Challis and Robinson (2010)](http://emis.impa.br/EMIS/journals/JIS/VOL13/Challis/challis6.pdf) to determine good source powers.
For example, suppose the bin bundle rows are desired to hold at least 70 items.
Then, looking at the tables in [Challis and Robinson (2010)](http://emis.impa.br/EMIS/journals/JIS/VOL13/Challis/challis6.pdf), we find the following possibly good source powers:

| Multiplicative depth | Source powers                                           | Highest power |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| 1 (h = 2)            | 1, 3, 4, 9, 11, 16, 20, 25, 27, 32, 33, 35, 36 (k = 13) | 72            |
| 2 (h = 3)            | 1, 4, 5, 15, 18, 27, 34 (k = 7)                         | 70            |
| 2 (h = 4)            | 1, 3, 11, 15, 32 (k = 5)                                | 70            |
| 3 (h = 5)            | 1, 4, 12, 21 (or 1, 5, 12, 28) (k = 4)                  | 71            |
| 3 (h = 6)            | 1, 4, 19, 33 (k = 4)                                    | 114           |

Several comments are in order:
- The second and the third row represent a communication-computationt trade-off. The two computations have the same depth (2), but one (second row) requires 40% more communication. The computational cost will be only slightly lower for the second row, because in both cases `70 - k` encrypted multiplications must be performed. Hence, we can conclude that the second row will almost certainly not make sense, and the third row is objectively better.
- It is not easy to compare rows with different multiplicative depth. Their performance differences will depend largely on the other protocol parameters &ndash; in particular the Microsoft SEAL encryption parameters.
- If depth 3 is acceptable, then the last row may be the best choice, as it allows the bin bundle row size to be increased from 70 to 114. This will result in fewer bin bundles, and hence smaller communication from the sender to the receiver.
However, now the sender must compute all powers of the query up to 114, increasing the online computation cost.
- It is probably necessary to try all options to determine what is overall best for a particular use-case.
- [Challis and Robinson (2010)](http://emis.impa.br/EMIS/journals/JIS/VOL13/Challis/challis6.pdf) also shows a possible set for `k = 3` with depth 3 (`h = 7`): `{ 1, 8, 13 }`. While this only allows a highest power of 69, which does not quite satisfy our requirement of 70, such a set should be considered as it reduces the receiver-to-sender communication by 25%, while increasing the sender-to-receiver communication by only a tiny amount (roughly by a factor of 70/69 = 1.45%) due to the slightly smaller bin bundles. This will almost certainly be a beneficial trade-off.

### Thread Control

Many of the computations APSI does are highly parallelizable.
APSI uses a thread pool that can be controlled with the static functions `apsi::ThreadPoolMgr::SetThreadCount` and `apsi::ThreadPoolMgr::GetThreadCount` in [apsi/thread_pool_mgr.h](common/apsi/thread_pool_mgr.h).

By default the thread count is set to `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()`, but this is in many cases not ideal due to caching issues, especially when hyper-threading is enabled.
Instead, the user would typically want to use `apsi::ThreadPoolMgr::SetThreadCount` to set it to some lower value depending on the number of physical cores.

### Logging

APSI can be optionally compiled to use [log4cplus](https://github.com/log4cplus/log4cplus) for logging.
Logging is configured using the static member functions of `apsi::Log` in [apsi/log.h](common/apsi/log.h).
For example, these can be used to set the log level (one of `"all"`, `"debug"`, `"info"`, `"warning"`, `"error"`, or `"off"`), set a log filename, and control console output.

Log messages for different log levels are emitted with the macros `APSI_LOG_DEBUG`, `APSI_LOG_INFO`, `APSI_LOG_WARNING`, and `APSI_LOG_ERROR`.
The macros allow "streaming"; for example,
```
int val = 3;
APSI_LOG_INFO("My value is " << val);
```
would log the message *My value is 3* at `"info"` log level.

## Building APSI

To simply use the APSI library, we recommend to build and install APSI with [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).
To try the commandline interface or run tests, follow the guide to build and install APSI manually.
### Requirements

| System  | Toolchain                                             |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows | Visual Studio 2019 with C++ CMake Tools for Windows   |
| Linux   | Clang++ (>= 7.0) or GNU G++ (>= 7.0), CMake (>= 3.12) |
| macOS   | Xcode toolchain (>= 9.3), CMake (>= 3.12)             |

### Building and Installing APSI with vcpkg

The easiest way is to download, build, and install APSI is using [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).

On Linux and macOS, first follow this [Quick Start on Unix](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#quick-start-unix), and then run:
```powershell
./vcpkg install apsi
```
On Windows, first follow this [Quick Start on Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#quick-start-windows), and then run:
```powershell
.\vcpkg install apsi:x64-windows-static-md
```

To build your CMake project with dependency on APSI, follow [this guide](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#using-vcpkg-with-cmake).

### Building and Installing APSI Manually

APSI has multiple external dependencies that must be pre-installed.
By far the easiest and recommended way to do this is using [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).
Each package's name in vcpkg is listed below.

**Note:** On Windows, the vcpkg triplet `x64-windows-static-md` should be specified.
For examples, to install Microsoft SEAL on Windows, you must use `.\vcpkg install seal[no-throw-tran]:x64-windows-static-md`, while on other systems use simply `./vcpkg install seal[no-throw-tran]`.

The CMake build system can then automatically find these pre-installed packages, if the following arguments are passed to CMake configuration:
- `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${vcpkg_root_dir}/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`, and
- `-DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET="x64-windows-static-md"` on Windows only.

| Dependency                                                | vcpkg name                                           |

| [Microsoft SEAL](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL)       | `seal[no-throw-tran]`                                |
| [Microsoft Kuku](https://github.com/microsoft/Kuku)       | `kuku`                                               |
| [Log4cplus](https://github.com/log4cplus/log4cplus)       | `log4cplus`                                          |
| [cppzmq](https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq)                | `cppzmq` (needed only for ZeroMQ networking support) |
| [FlatBuffers](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers)      | `flatbuffers`                                        |
| [jsoncpp](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp) | `jsoncpp`                                            |
| [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest)       | `gtest` (needed only for building tests)             |
| [TCLAP](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tclap/)          | `tclap` (needed only for building CLI)               |

#### Note on Microsoft SEAL and Intel HEXL

[Intel HEXL](https://github.com/intel/hexl) is an optional dependency of Microsoft SEAL, which aims to accelerate low-level arithmetic with advanced vector extensions.
Any potential benefit of using Intel HEXL is highly dependent on the processor, but on Cascade lake and Ice Lake Xeon processors it can have an enormous impact on the online computation time of APSI sender operations.
To build Microsoft SEAL with Intel HEXL support, install `seal[no-throw-tran,hexl]` instead of the vcpkg name listed above.

## Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The APSI library comes with example command-line programs implementing a sender and a receiver.
In this section we describe how to run these programs.

### Common Arguments

The following optional arguments are common both to the sender and the receiver applications.

| Parameter | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| `-t` \| `--threads` | Number of threads to use |
| `-f` \| `--logFile` | Log file path |
| `-s` \| `--silent` | Do not write output to console |
| `-l` \| `--logLevel` | One of `all`, `debug`, `info` (default), `warning`, `error`, `off` |

### Receiver

The following arguments specify the receiver's behavior.

| Parameter | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| `-q` \| `--queryFile` | Path to a text file containing query data (one per line) |
| `-o` \| `--outFile` | Path to a file where intersection result will be written |
| `-a` \| `--ipAddr` | IP address for a sender endpoint |
| `--port` | TCP port to connect to (default is 1212) |

### Sender

The following arguments specify the sender's behavior and determine the parameters for the protocol.
In our CLI implementation the sender always chooses the parameters and the receiver obtains them through a parameter request.
Note that in other applications the receiver may already know the parameters, and the parameter request may not be necessary.

| <div style="width:190px">Parameter</div> | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| `-d` \| `--dbFile` | Path to a CSV file describing the sender's dataset (an item-label pair on each row) or a file containing a serialized `SenderDB`; the CLI will first attempt to load the data as a serialized `SenderDB`, and &ndash; upon failure &ndash; will proceed to attempt to read it as a CSV file |
| `-p` \| `--paramsFile` | Path to a JSON file [describing the parameters](#loading-from-json) to be used by the sender
| `--port` | TCP port to bind to (default is 1212) |
| `-n` \| `--nonceByteCount` | Number of bytes used for the nonce in labeled mode (default is 16) |
| `-c` \| `--compress` | Whether to compress the SenderDB in memory; this will make the memory footprint smaller at the cost of increased computation |

**Note:** The first row of the CSV file provided to `--dbFile` determines whether APSI will be used in unlabeled or labeled mode.
If the first row contains two values, the first will be interpreted as the item and the rest will be interpreted as the label data.
Leading and trailing whitespaces will be trimmed from both the item and the label data.
If the first row contains only a single value (i.e., no label), then APSI will read only items from the subsequent rows and set up an unlabeled `SenderDB` instance.
In the labeled mode the longest label appearing will determine the label byte count.

### Test Data

The library contains a Python script [tools/scripts/test_data_creator.py](tools/scripts/test_data_creator.py) that can be used to easily create test data for the CLI.
Running the script is easy; it accepts three necessary arguments and two optional parameters as follows:
```
python3 test_data_creator.py <sender_size> <receiver_size> <intersection_size> [<label_byte_count>] [<item_byte_count>]
```
Here `<sender_size>` denotes the size of the sender's dataset that will be written in a file `db.csv`.
If this file already exists, it will be overwritten.
Similarly `<receiver_size>` denotes the size of the receiver's query that will be written in a file `query.csv`.
The third argument, `<intersection_size>`, denotes the number of items common in both the generated `db.csv` and `query.csv`.
The fourth (optional) argument denotes the byte size of the randomly generated labels in `db.csv`; if omitted, the data will be unlabeled.
The last (optional) argument denotes the item byte size; it defaults to 64 if omitted.
Since long the items will automatically be hashed before they are inserted into a `SenderDB`, the item byte size does not matter much in practice.
